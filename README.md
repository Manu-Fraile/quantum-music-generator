# Quantum Music Generator
Today you will hear Quantum Mechanics perhaps for the first time in your life. This is a musical representation in the scale of Do Major of quantum superposition, quantum randomness and quantum states. Enjoy ðŸ«¶


This project explores the use of quantum computing to generate music using Qiskit and Python. By leveraging quantum states and superposition, we create probabilistic patterns that map to musical notes and rhythms.

## Features
- Generate simple melodies using quantum circuits.
- Explore quantum principles like superposition and entanglement in a creative context.
- Customize tempo, scale, and note patterns.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- pydub (for audio generation)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Code
- Use the `notebooks/Quantum_Music_Generator.ipynb` notebook to explore the project and generate music.
- The generated output will be playable audio files.

## Concepts
- **Superposition**: Using quantum states to represent multiple possible notes.
- **Entanglement**: Creating melodic structures with quantum circuits.
